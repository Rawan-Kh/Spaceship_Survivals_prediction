# Spaceship Titanic
## Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension

## Problem definition Summary:
The Spaceship Titanic, an interstellar passenger liner, recently embarked on its inaugural voyage with the mission of transporting emigrants to three newly habitable exoplanets. However, tragedy struck when the spaceship collided with a hidden spacetime anomaly near Alpha Centauri, leading to a fate reminiscent of the original Titanic. Although the vessel remained intact, approximately half of the passengers—nearly 6,500 individuals—were unexpectedly transported to an alternate dimension. To aid in the rescue and recovery efforts, the challenge is to predict which passengers experienced this anomaly using the available records retrieved from the damaged computer system of the spaceship.


● Cleansed and preprocessed the collected data by removing noise, handling missing values, and standardizing the format for further analysis.<br/>
● Performed feature engineering by extracting relevant features and enhancing the dataset.<br/>
● Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data.<br/>
● Trained classification models using the RandomForestClassifier and GradientBoostingClassifier algorithms from the scikit-learn library.<br/>
● Employed the GridSearchCV module from scikit-learn to perform hyperparameter tuning and optimize the models' performance.<br/>
● Evaluated the trained models using metrics such as accuracy_score, precision_score, and recall_score.<br/>
● Based on the evaluation results, I saved the best-performing model.<br/>
